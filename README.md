The Append Editor is a [Custom Editor](https://standardnotes.org/help/77/what-are-editors) for [Standard Notes](https://standardnotes.org). It is currently in active development. When it is ready for use, it will be part of the [Standard Notes Extensions](https://standardnotes.org/extensions). :smile:

This editor follows the "read first" philosophy. The editor opens your notes in read/view mode so you don't accidentally edit old notes as you're reading them. While in view mode, you can easily add to the end of your notes with the Append box at the bottom. Support for Markdown and LaTeX/KaTeX are built-in. This editor is perfect for writing class notes and daily journals. 

This editor works best on the [Desktop app](https://standardnotes.org/download) and [web](https://app.standardnotes.org) app on a Chromium browser (e.g., Google Chrome), this editor works best when used with the [No Distraction](https://standardnotes.org/extensions/no-distraction) theme. 

## Features

## Development

The instructions for local setup can be found [here](https://docs.standardnotes.org/extensions/local-setup). All commands are performed in the root directory:

1. Run `npm install` to locally install the packages in `package.json`
2. Create `ext.json` as shown [here](https://docs.standardnotes.org/extensions/local-setup) with `url: "http://localhost:8003/dist/index.html"`. Optionally, create your `ext.json` as a copy of `ext.json.sample`.
3. Install http-server using `sudo npm install -g http-server`
4. Start the server at `http://localhost:8003` using `npm run server`
5. Import the extension into the [web](https://app.standardnotes.org) or [desktop](https://standardnotes.org/download) app with `http://localhost:8003/ext.json`.
6. To build the editor, open another command window and run `npm run build`. For live builds, use `npm run watch`. You can also run `npm run start` and open the editor at `http://localhost:8080`.
